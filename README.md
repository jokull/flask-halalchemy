flask_hal.py
============

Expose SQLAlchemy model instances and paginated querysets as **hal+json**
resources. Warning: Donâ€™t fall in love with this idea. It is only meant to
quickly expose a `Model` and supply hooks to validate incoming data. Generally
speaking you should aim to expose processes not just map CRUD SQL operations
to the HTTP verbs. That being said, I believe this is a common enough scenario
to automate.

I have made an effort not to tie it too deeply into SQLAlchemy so it would be
easy to adopt other database storages. The biggest blocker is the
Flask-SQLAlchemy pagination class.

Three Flask class based views are provided:

 + `ResourceView`: A hal+json resource for Model instances
 + `IndexView`: A paginated hal+json resource for Model querysets
 + `FormView`: Validates incoming JSON data, reports errors nicely (POSTs to
               indexes and PATCHes resources)

The following assumptions are made:

 + `get_query` returns a result set for `IndexView` and a SQLAlchemy `Query`
   instance for `ResourceView`.
 + Models have a `json` attribute that exposes publically available fields
   and their values. This is what what your API consumer sees.
 + You are ok with using dictshield fields and validation :)

The GET method is already implemented for `ResourceView` and `IndexView`
resources.

See `example.py` for ... an example.
